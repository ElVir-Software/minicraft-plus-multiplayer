# Minicraft Plus Online
##Important Note!
Due to renovations to the server room, the server will be offline 3 days from 01/09 to the 03/09.
Meanwhile use a older minicraft version. Sorry for the inconveniences.
## Introduction
On the 20th of August 2021, Chris J. ([chris42](https://github.com/chrisj42)) announced in the [Official Minicraft+ Discord Server](https://discord.gg/JyvFcRBguE) that the multiplayer functionality would be disabled from then on due to bad implementation and login server issues. It was at this point that I decided to make a port to keep multiplayer alive as I consider it's one of minicraft most important features. This is why this repository was created.
## Relation with Minicraft+
This is only a port of [Minicraft+](https://github.com/chrisj42/minicraft-plus-revived), which is developed by the community, by which I mean, I only make sure the multiplayer is working.
## Getting Started
If you want to play minicraft+ online, you should create an account [here](https://minicraft.slowflow.ml).
## What are the objectives of this port?
This port tries to mirror the [Minicraft+ Repository](https://github.com/chrisj42/minicraft-plus-revived) and aims to add support for multiplayer, make it more secure, introduce improvements and fix multiplayer related bugs.
## Contributing
Feel free to open any issues if you find bugs related to the multiplayer functionality, if it's a base game bug open it [here](https://github.com/chrisj42/minicraft-plus-revived/issues).
If you want to improve the code or fix it, feel free to open a pull request.
